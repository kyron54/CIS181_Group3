Welcome to Runners Peak
Our mission is to help marathon runners or those desiring to become a marathon runner train efficiently and safely. Please feel free to explore Runners Peak for training plans, marathon nutritional advice, gear recommendations, recovery strategies, and motivational content.

<h1>About Us</h1>
Runners Peak was birthed through the collaboration of four college students given a group project to create a web site. We are passionate about helping to build a community of people who aspire to adopt a lifestyle of physical fitness through running. We educate, motivate, and offer tools to support those desiring to complete a marathon race. To train and run in a race requires discipline, resilience, and perseverence which are admirable traits to facilitate character development.
