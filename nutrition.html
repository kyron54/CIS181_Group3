            <h2>Fuel Up The Right Way</h2>
            <p>
                Preparing for a race requires fuel for your body to work efficiently. 
                The most important part of preparing for any physical activity, especially a footrace, is: <strong>Always eat enough</strong>. 
                Eating too much may not be beneficial, but eating too little can cause a deficit in the energy needed to sustain oneself during a race.

            <h2 class="section-title">Maintaining a Good Diet</h2>
            <p>
                Maintaining a good diet will be essential for anybody, regardless of their activity level. That said, an over-focus on maintaining the “perfect” diet or following specific athlete diets may cause more trouble than it is worth. 
                For example, a popular diet strategy to follow before working out or running is known as “carb-loading.” 
                This strategy may be marginally beneficial for energy levels if done with intense calculation and precision, however, the work needed to do it properly is not worth the risk of doing it incorrectly. 
                Incorrect application of such a diet strategy can be self-sabotaging right before a race. Instead of relying on precision, it is much better to eat with consistency and intention.

                <h2 class="section-title">The Runner's Diet</h2>
                <p>
                    So what does a runner’s diet look like? There is no one-size-fits-all, as everyone’s body is different, but generally, runners should shoot for a diet consisting of roughly 60% of calories made from carbohydrates, with roughly 20% of their diet being lean protein and healthy fats. 
                    In general, the longer the distance you run, the more carbs your body will need. This is because your body recovers using both glucose and glycogen. 
                    Glycogen is the sugar stored in your liver and muscles and is the primary fuel for endurance exercise. Eating carbs prevents your energy from depleting too fast, causing you to burn out.
                </p>

                <h3 class="list-header">Food That is Beneficial for Runners:</h3>
                <ul class="food-list">
                    <li>Fruit and vegetables</li>
                    <li>Protein such as fish, poultry, beans, lentils, and tofu.</li>
                    <li>Healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado oil, nuts, some seeds (Chia, Hemp, Flax, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Healthy carbohydrates such as rice, whole grain bread/pasta, and oatmeal</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Additionally, paying attention to your vitamin intake is essential to maintaining good energy, health, and safety while running.
                </p>

                <h3 class="list-header">Vitamins to Watch Include:</h3>
                <ul class="food-list">
                    <li><strong>Calcium</strong>: yogurt, cheese, tofu, edamame, almonds, canned fish with bones</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>: fortified dairy, almond, soy, or rice beverages, eggs, tuna, and salmon</li>
                    <li><strong>Iron</strong>: poultry, legumes, peas, beans, kale, and spinach</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Eating After a Race</h2>
                <p>In general, the best time to eat is about two to three hours before starting your run. 
                    It is recommended not to eat too much fiber right before a race. 
                    If you want to snack before you run, try carbohydrate foods that are easy to digest, such as:
                </p>
                <ul class="food-list">
                    <li>Bananas</li>
                    <li>Applesauce</li>
                    <li>Crackers or pretzels</li>
                    <li>White bread</li>
                    <li>Potatoes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Lastly, it is important to listen to your body. 
                    Do not continue to eat something simply because it works for others or because it is recommended; 
                    instead, assess how you feel and consult a dietitian to find out what works best for you.
