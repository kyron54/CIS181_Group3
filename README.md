# CIS181_Group3
Marathon running website created for CIS181.

Hey team, It's Kyron. I made this codespace to run and update the website altogether so we can reference each other's pages in real time. I made this based on Kaleb's docs that were already styled.

Okay, A few things. In order to run a website you will need to follow a few steps. 
1. type into the Terminal: "python -m http.server". This will run the website on the 8000 port. 
2. Click ports down below and mouse over the 8000 port. It should have a green circle next to it.
3. When moused over, the port should have an globe icon appear. You want to click that to see the website run. The website should open in another tab.
