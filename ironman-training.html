            <h2>The Ultimate Endurance Challenge</h2>
            <p>The Ironman triathlon (2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike, 26.2-mile run) represents the pinnacle of endurance sports. Conquering this event demands not just physical strength, but also mental fortitude, strategic planning, and disciplined training across three distinct disciplines.</p>

        <section class="plan-overview">
            <h2 class="section-title">Comprehensive Multisport Training</h2>
            <p>Our Ironman training plan is designed to transform dedicated athletes into complete triathletes capable of conquering the full 140.6 miles. This program blends swimming, cycling, running, and strength training into a progressive framework that builds endurance while preventing injury.</p>
            <p>This 24-30 week program accommodates athletes coming from different backgrounds, whether you're a strong runner looking to improve your swim, or a cyclist building running endurance. The plan includes periodization to peak at the right time for your A-race.</p>

                <h3>Your Weekly Structure</h3>
                <ul class="training-list">
                    <li>9-12 training sessions per week (3 swims, 3-4 bikes, 3 runs, 1-2 strength)</li>
                    <li>Long swims building to 4000 yards/meters</li>
                    <li>Long rides extending to 100+ miles</li>
                    <li>Long runs building to 18-20 miles</li>
                    <li>1-2 recovery days per week</li>

                <ol class="training-list">
                    <li><strong>Swim Technique Sessions:</strong> Focus on efficiency and form with drills and interval work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long Brick Workouts:</strong> Bike-to-run transitions to train your legs for the specific demands of triathlon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Progressive Long Rides:</strong> Building both duration and intensity to simulate race conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tempo Runs:</strong> Mid-distance runs at moderate-to-hard effort to build running efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Race Simulation Days:</strong> Practicing nutrition, pacing, and transitions in conditions similar to race day.</li>

                    <h3>The Swim (2.4 miles)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Start Position:</strong> Position yourself based on your realistic swim time. Unless you're a front-pack swimmer, consider starting wide or hanging back 5-10 seconds to avoid the chaos.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pacing:</strong> The swim is about 10% of your day but can drain 40% of your energy if done poorly. Stay relaxed, find your rhythm, and swim within yourself.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mile-strategy">
                    <h3>The Bike (112 miles)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Power Management:</strong> Stay 10-15% below your FTP for most of the ride. The first 50 miles should feel easyâ€”that's intentional. The race doesn't begin until the run.</p>
                    <p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Consume 60-90g carbs per hour and stay on top of hydration and electrolytes. The bike is where you fuel for the entire race.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mile-strategy">
                    <h3>The Run (26.2 miles)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Start Conservative:</strong> Begin at a pace that feels too easy. The first 10K will dictate your marathon.</p>
                    <p><strong>Break It Down:</strong> Don't think about 26.2 miles. Focus on reaching the next aid station, which comes every mile.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Every Ironman run includes rough patches. Walk aid stations if needed, reset your nutrition, and keep moving forward.</p>

                    <p>Wake up 3+ hours before race start. Consume 500-800 calories of easily digestible carbs, moderate protein, and low fat. Practice this meal in training. Sip on electrolyte drinks up until race start.</p>

                    <p>Immediate post-race: Fluid, sodium, and easy carbs. First 24 hours: Rehydrate with electrolytes, consume protein for muscle repair, and eat anti-inflammatory foods. Focus on sleep and active recovery in the following days.</p>
