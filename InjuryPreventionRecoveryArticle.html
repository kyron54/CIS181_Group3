            <h2>Preventing Injuries</h2>
            <p>Marathon training is a rewarding journey, but it also places demands on your body that can lead to injury if not properly managed. Key prevention strategies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gradual Progression:</strong> Increase mileage slowly—no more than 10% per week—to give your body time to adapt.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Footwear:</strong> Invest in high-quality running shoes appropriate for your gait and foot type. Replace them every 300–500 miles.</li>
                <li><strong>Warm-Ups and Cool-Downs:</strong> Include dynamic warm-ups before runs and static stretches afterward to maintain flexibility and reduce strain.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Training:</strong> Incorporate low-impact activities like swimming, cycling, or yoga to strengthen supporting muscles and give running muscles a break.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to persistent aches, which may signal overtraining or potential injury. Rest days are essential.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recovery Tips</h2>
            <p>Whether it’s after a long training run or completing your marathon, recovery is crucial for muscle repair and performance maintenance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rehydrate and Refuel:</strong> Drink plenty of fluids and eat a balanced meal with protein and carbohydrates within 30–60 minutes after running.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night. This is when your body does most of its repair work.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Recovery:</strong> Gentle movement like walking or light cycling improves blood flow and reduces soreness.</li>
                <li><strong>Massage and Foam Rolling:</strong> Help release muscle tightness and promote healing.</li>
                <li><strong>Rest Days:</strong> Schedule at least one full rest day per week during training and more post-race if needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Injuries and Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Runner’s Knee:</strong> Often due to overuse or weak thigh muscles. Strength training and proper shoes can help.</li>
                <li><strong>Shin Splints:</strong> May result from increasing mileage too quickly. Ice, rest, and better shoes usually relieve symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>IT Band Syndrome:</strong> A sharp pain on the outside of the knee. Stretching, foam rolling, and cross-training can reduce symptoms.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember: Rest and consistency go hand in hand. Preventing injuries and allowing adequate time to recover helps you stay on track toward your marathon goals.</p>
